# My Journal

This is a diary where I describe everything about how I created this project.

## So how much time did I spend on that?

I think I spent about 25 hours on this project.

## My worst hangups

- Unfortunately, I designed the bottom part of the case incorrectly, so I had to redo it completely.
- My RFID module hasn't been working for a while, so I had to solve this error as well.
- The website also didn't work for me because I broke it completely while coding.
